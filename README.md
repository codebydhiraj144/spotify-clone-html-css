# spotify-clone-html-css
This is a Spotify Clone UI built using pure HTML and CSS. The project replicates the design of Spotifyâ€™s web player with a sidebar, navigation bar, cards for playlists, and a music player section at the bottom.  ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s a frontend-only project (no JavaScript functionality), created to practice responsive layout, CSS styling, and modern UI design.
